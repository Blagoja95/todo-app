## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this todo app and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size ‚úÖ
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page ‚úÖ
- Add new todos to the list ‚úÖ
- Mark todos as complete ‚úÖ
- Delete todos from the list ‚úÖ
- Filter by all/active/complete todos ‚úÖ
- Clear all completed todos ‚úÖ
- Toggle light and dark mode ‚úÖ
- **Bonus**: Drag and drop to reorder items on the list (‚úñÔ∏è todo)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SASS
- JavaScript
- BEM
- MVC Architecture
- Mobile-first workflow

**First step was planing:**
![General plane of html file](./readmeAssets/Screenshot%202022-03-21%20at%2014-44-16%20Figma.png)

- made a main with 4 sections: title, input, todo and manage sections;
- footer is just one modified attributon that you get with evrey starter file
- all elements got classes by BEM methodology, where all buttons have comon class `btn` and each iteration of button element have modifier class like `btn--active`

**Second step was styling:**

- I used CSS preprocessor SASS
- made few .scss files to brake my sass code into smaller, more managable partial files and one main.scss file where all partials will be imported;
- like \_colors wher a placed all color values provided by starter files
- provided desing files are made for mobile 375px and desktop 1440px, so I used queries and brakepoints to make app look good on different viewports.
- Becouse I used mobile first workflow when making look of the app, I used min-width in my brakepoints

**Next and hardest step was JS:**
